 About the use of Sentry in OpenERP
====================================

The Sentry is a log aggregator.  Raven the official Python client for Sentry.

Using Sentry for OpenERP/Odoo may lead to better insight about the errors that
are being produced in your production servers.

The `sentrylog` module provides a SentryHandler, and a `patch_logging`
function to make the standard logging mechanism log to the Sentry.  To
configure the client you need to fill the keys of the dictionary
``xoeuf.sentrylog.conf``.


Raven concurrency model
=======================

The Raven client uses a threaded model to send the logs to the Sentry server.

This is actually the only option when running OpenERP 7.0.  In Odoo somethings
are using a gevent_ loop, but other run in threads.  It seems that the raven
threaded model still is the only choice in this scenario.

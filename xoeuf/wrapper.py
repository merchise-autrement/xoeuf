'''Wraps write operations.

Usage::

  @write_wrapper()
  def wrapper(sender, **kwargs):
      yield

The wrapper must yield exactly once.  All the code above the 'yield' will be
executed before the actual write.  All the code below the 'yield' will be
executed after the write.  You can have as many wrappers as you want.

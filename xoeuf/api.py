    '''A `multi` that ensures `self` comes from the active_ids in the context.

    The context key 'active_model' must be set and match the recordset's
    model.  If the 'active_model' key does not match the recordset's model,
    call `f` with the given recordset, i.e act like `api.multi`:func:.

    If 'active_model' matches the recordset's, and 'active_ids' is not empty,
    run `f` with the recordset of active ids.

    `f` is automatically decorated with `api.multi`:func:.

    The expected use is in methods from a server action linked to an
    ir.value.  In those cases `self` is normally the first selected record,
    but you want it to be run with all selected records.

    If `leak_context` is False (the default is True), `f` will run a recordset
    without 'active_model'.  This allows to call methods of the same model
    which are decorated with `from_active_ids` but without *leaking* the
    'active_model'.  Technically we set the 'active_model' key to None.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.34.0 Add the `leak_context` argument.  And allow `f`
       to take arguments (other than `self`).

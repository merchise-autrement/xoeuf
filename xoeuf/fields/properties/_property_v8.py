    '''A property-like field.

    This is always non-store field.  In fact, you may only pass the getter,
    setter and deleter functions.

    .. warning:: This is a kind of hack.

       Normal Python `properties <property>` are not copied through Odoo
       inheritance mechanisms.  This `Property` is a Field and Odoo accounts
       for it.  But, it is NOT an actual ORM field in the sense that it's
       never interacts with the DB.  Therefore:

       - You MUST NEVER use `write()` or `create()` on these type of fields.
         You may update the value via the `setter`.

       - You cannot `search()` for this type of fields.

    The getter, setter and deleter functions receive (and thus we required it)
    a singleton recordset instance.

    Usage::

       @Property
       def result(self):
           return 1

       @result.setter
       def result(self, value):
          pass

    You may also do::

       def _set_result(self, value):
           pass

       result = Property(lambda s: 1, setter=_set_result)
       del _set_result

class Property(Base):
    '''A property-like field.

    This is always non-store field.  In fact, you may only pass the getter,
    setter and deleter functions.

    .. warning:: This is a kind of hack.

       Normal Python `properties <property>` are not copied through Odoo
       inheritance mechanisms.  This `Property` is a Field and Odoo accounts
       for it.  But, it is NOT an actual ORM field in the sense that it
       never interacts with the DB.  Therefore:

       - You MUST NEVER use `write()` or `create()` on these type of fields.
         You may update the value via the `setter` (i.e assign it).

       - You cannot `search()` for this type of fields.

       - You cannot use Property fields in views.

         The main difference to any other computed field is that Property is
         untyped.  We don't enforce any type check on the value returned by
         getters.  But, then, we cannot communicate which widget can manage
         the value of a Property.

    The getter, setter and deleter functions receive (and thus we required it)
    a singleton recordset instance.  The onsetup functions receive the field
    instance, and the model on which the field is being setup.

    Usage::

       @Property
       def result(self):
           return 1

       @result.setter
       def result(self, value):
          pass

    You may also do::

       def _set_result(self, value):
           pass

       result = Property(lambda s: 1, setter=_set_result)
       del _set_result

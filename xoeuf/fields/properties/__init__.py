class PropertyField(Base):
    """A property-like field.

    This is always non-store field.  In fact, you may only pass the getter,
    setter and deleter functions.

    .. warning:: This is a kind of hack.

       Normal Python `properties <property>`:class: are not copied through
       Odoo inheritance mechanisms.  This `Property` is a Field and Odoo
       accounts for it.  But, it is NOT an actual ORM field in the sense that
       it never interacts with the DB.  Therefore:

       - You MUST NEVER use ``write()`` or ``create()`` on these type of
         fields.  You may update the value via the `setter` (i.e assign it).

       - You cannot ``search()`` for this type of fields.

       - You cannot use Property fields in views.

         The main difference to any other computed field is that Property is
         untyped.  We don't enforce any type check on the value returned by
         getters.  But, then, we cannot communicate which widget can manage
         the value of a Property.

    The `getter`, `setter` and `deleter` functions receive (and thus we
    required it) a singleton recordset instance.  The `onsetup` function
    receive the field instance, and the model on which the field is being
    setup.

    Usage::

       @Property
       def result(self):
           return 1

       @result.setter
       def result(self, value):
          pass

       @Property(memoize=True)
       def sentinel(self):
           return object()

    You may also do::

       def _set_result(self, value):
           pass

       result = Property(lambda s: 1, setter=_set_result)
       del _set_result

    :keyword memoize: If True, the property will cache the result.  The
             default is False (compute each time the property is read).

    .. versionchanged:: 0.58.0 Added keyword parameter `memoize`.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.67.0 Invalidate Odoo's cache of dependant computable
       fields.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.68.0 Actively trigger recomputation on dependant
       fields.

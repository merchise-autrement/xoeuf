def Enumeration(enumclass, *args, **kwargs):
    '''Create an enumeration field.

    The `enumclass` argument must be either an `enumeration class` or a
    fully qualified name of an enumeration class.

    At the DB level the enumeration will be an integer.  This requires that
    the members of provided enumeration class are instances of `int` (probably
    via a subclass).

    Enumeration classes are required to:

    - have an attribute ``__members__`` with a `collections.Mapping`:class:
      from names to values.

    - have an attribute for each name in ``__member__`` with the same value as
      in the mapping.

    Those rules imply::

       >>> all(getattr(Enumclass, name) is value and isinstance(value, int)
       ...     for name, value in Enumclass.__members__.items())

    .. note:: These requirements are compatible with Python 3.4's
       `enum.IntEnum`:class:

       Notice, however, that we don't require that members are instances of
       the enumeration class.  But it won't hurt.

    .. warning:: The returned field is a subclass of
                 `xoeuf.fields.Integer`:class: and it's a new API field.
